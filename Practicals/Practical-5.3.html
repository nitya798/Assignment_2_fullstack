        JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. 
        It is designed for creating network-centric applications.
         It is complimentary to and integrated with Java.
          JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. 
        It is open and cross-platform.
        JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with 
        types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.
         Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages
         â€” many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well.
